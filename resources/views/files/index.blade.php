                        Zuzana helped design freeCodeCamp's new user profile and settings pages. She has been a valuable
                        contributor, reliable and responsible, and able to iterate on new design ideas. Working with her
                        has been a pleasure. Zuzana would be a great asset to any team.

                        Zuzana is one of the most determined and self-directed people I know and this comes across in
                        her approach to her work: detail conscious, conscientious, thorough. Her deep understanding of
                        psychological principles makes a real difference - you'll get a full understanding of user
                        experience, psychological aspects of website design and accessibility issues as well as
                        all-round coding and technical skills.

                        As our agency grows we are constantly searching for reliable partners to help us service the
                        growing needs of our customers. Zuzana has proven to be just that developer. We find her
                        incredibly useful when we need to outsource part of the WordPress website development process,
                        or look to add in custom functionality on a project. Zuzana is professional and good at what she
                        does, but she's also lovely to communicate with. We trust her to complete projects on spec and
                        on time, and we will continue to outsource to her as we grow further.

                        I have had the pleasure to work with Zuzana on a recent project of ours. Above all, I was most
                        impressed by Zuzanaâ€™s attention to detail, and her thorough approach to delivering the work we
                        assigned her. Zuzana was very systematic in organising her workload, and always kept a very
                        detailed list of updates or issues to discuss in our daily stand-ups. Communication with Zuzana
                        was flawless from day one, and I very much look forward to working with her again soon.
